# Newton Method-based Subspace Support Vector Data Description

This repository is for Newton Method-based Subspace Support Vector Data Description (NSSVDD). The codes are provided as .m (matlab) files to be executed in matlab. The codes are provided without any warranty or gurantee. Download the package from [HERE](https://github.com/fahadsohrab/nssvdd/archive/main.zip), unzip and add the folder nssvdd-main to the path in matlab. see **NSSVDDdemo.m** for exmaple usage.

# Requirements
NSSVDD requires *LIBSVM for SVDD*. Before executing the codes, make sure that correct version (3.22) of *LIBSVM for SVDD* is installed already. In order to install *LIBSVM for SVDD*  Please download zip file from [HERE](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/svdd/libsvm-svdd-3.22.zip), put sources into libsvm-3.22 available [HERE](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/oldfiles/libsvm-3.22.zip), and make the code. For more details about how to install libsvm, please refer [HERE](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/#libsvm_for_svdd_and_finding_the_smallest_sphere_containing_all_data)
